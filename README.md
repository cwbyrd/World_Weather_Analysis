# World_Weather_Analysis
## The purpose of this project is to retrieve weather data and add a desription, then create a customer travel destinations map, and finally, to create a destination iternary map. 
### Retrieve Weather Data: This will be done by collecting a set of locations by lattidude and longitude to determine a particular city with an API call. We then create a dataframe with a variety of weather data, including a new piece of information representing the current description.  


### Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map: Here we collect customer preferences, and use that to locate ideal hotels based on that input. In this instance, we use a minimum and maximum temperature. In this instance, the mimimum temperature = 70 degrees and the max = 90 degrees Farenheight. 


### Create a travel itinerary map: In this part of the project, we are using Google's Directions API to show a route between 4 cities. We end up creating a marker layer map with popups for each city.
